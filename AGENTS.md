# Migration Plan: Rust Codex CLI to .NET

## Completed
- Bootstrapped the .NET CLI with configuration loading, interactive mode and basic subcommands.
- Added session/history management, sandbox enforcement, patch apply and replay tools.
- Implemented provider and API key management with OpenAI integration.
- Ported the TUI with chat, status and bottom pane widgets plus approval handling.
- Implemented MCP client/server features with SSE watch-events and parity tests.
- Updated Rust and C# files with status comments marking migrated components done.
